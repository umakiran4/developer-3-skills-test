# HTML/CSS Challenge

This test is designed to challenge your mastery of HTML and CSS. We are looking for developers who can create clean, efficient, and valid UI code. Please use the files in this folder to code a basic page using semantic HTML and efficient CSS.

## User Story
As a site owner, I want a working proof of concept (POC) of the new article page with placeholders of the components.

## Background
CMG business leaders have requested a new website to target new customers in its Texas market - The Texas Journal. You have been assigned the task of developing a basic news article POC for the site. The page should be responsive and include a header, footer, body, left and right rail. Your work will be used as a starting point for other developers to build the real site components.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Create your POC starting with a file named `index.html`.
* The POC should:
  * use semantic HTML tags when possible.
  * be optimized for SEO.
  * match the mock image attached.
  * be responsive with 2 breakpoints: 0-992px and 992px+.
* The vertical order of the mobile layout should be center well, left rail, right rail.
* You do not have to exactly match all the details such as colors, fonts, icons, exact dimensions or text.
  * Remember you are only developing placeholders for the actual modules.
  * Feel free to use lorem ipsum filler text.
* Since this challenge is focused on your skills with HTML and CSS, please avoid using JavaScript.
* We encourage the use of Bootstrap.
