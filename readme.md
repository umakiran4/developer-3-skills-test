# CMGtech Developer III Skills Test

This is a senior-level developer competency test to gauge your mastery of creating quality software. Your work as a developer at CMG Technology will be used to improve and maintain the web-presence of our media companies such as [AJC](//www.ajc.com), [Statesman](//www.statesman.com), and [PalmBeachPost](//www.palmbeachpost.com).

## What are the rules?
Please complete all challenges. Each challenge contains its own readme with instructions.

## How should I submit my test?
We use Git as our primary vcs. Fork this repository, complete the test, then create a pull request against master.

## Anything else?
* Quality counts! A good submission that takes a while is better than a poor submission quickly. 
* Make sure your submission accurately reflects your development style.
* Commit early and often, with good messages.

We are expecting senior-level code to be coherently blocked with informative comments and a general sense that you a master of your craft. We also love to see code that is self-documented, well organized, and gives the distinct impression that this would be easy to maintain for years to come. Show us your best and good luck!
